<h1> Text-to-Picture Generation </h1>

<h2> Project Description </h2>

I will be focusing on training a neural network for the task of generating images based on textual descriptions. I will
create an application that takes in text and converts to an accurate pictoral representation. Potential applications
include everything from tabletop games to new forms of art to custom emojis/descriptory messaging.

There is an existing project called <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/"> Dall-E </a> that does very similar work,
but on 3D
images. Another tool using GPT-3 is <a
    href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/gpt3-ai-tool-designs-websites-medicine-a9627966.html">
    generating
    websites</a> based on text. So the technology is there, this project would just have to train it specifically to do
the sorts of
things we want to. I would probably be housing this application as a Discord bot or something similar, so that it is
easily accessible to the people who'd like to use it.

The longer term goal would be to help create simulations of realistic environments from a description, for use in
building VR worlds. Results from this work will probably bleed in to my own long-term project of building a flight
simulator.

<h2> Project Goals </h2>

<ol>
    <li>Research the GPT architecture and existing solutions</li>
    <li>Explore and try to implement models to create images from text, preferrably transfering learning from an
        existing
        model.</li>
    <li>Create an application to host our architecture.</li>
